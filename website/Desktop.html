		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p>  The Queenstown Lakes District Is The Second Fastest Growing Council In New 
		Zealand According to 2013 census information released today (Tuesday) by Statistics
		 NZ, the districts population is now 28,224 a 23 per cent lift from the last 
		 census in 2007. Only the Selwyn district, near Christchurch, grew faster. The Otago 
		 region grew almost five per cent, but three-fifths of that growth came from 
		 Queenstown-Lakes. Re-elected Queenstown mayor Vanessa van Uden says the census 
		 figure reinforce what the council knows, that the area remains a highly desirable
		  place to live and visit. Councils planning had to factor in the impacts of high 
		  growth, she says. "Some of these impacts are highly positive such as greater 
		  economic growth, an increased rating base which will help minimise ratepayer
		   costs and increased property values for existing homeowners. But against that 
		   are things such as increasing difficulty for families wanting to buy their first 
		   home and greater demands on our core infrastructure." Van Uden says the census 
		   figures will help her council update its Long Term Plan next year. </p>
